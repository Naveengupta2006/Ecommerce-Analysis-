# 🛒 E-Commerce Analysis  

A data analytics project exploring e-commerce purchase data through **data cleaning, statistical insights, and NumPy calculations**.  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Gender`, `Purchase Amount`, and `Product Category`.  
- Removed duplicates and standardized categorical data.  

---

## ❓ Missing Value Analysis  
- Checked for null values in all columns.  
- Imputed missing entries where necessary.  

---

## 👩‍🦰👨 Average Purchase by Gender  
- Compared average purchase amounts between **Male** and **Female** customers.  
- Insights into gender-based purchasing behavior.  

---

## 📂 Average Purchase by Product Category  
- Calculated mean purchase amount for each **Product Category**.  
- Identified top-performing categories in terms of revenue.  

---

## 📊 Standard Deviation by Category  
- Measured variability in purchase amounts across categories.  
- Found which categories had consistent vs. fluctuating spending.  

---

## 🔗 Correlation Between Age & Purchase Amount  
- Computed correlation coefficient between `Age` and `Purchase Amount`.  
- Visualized with scatter plots and regression line.  

---

## 🔢 NumPy Calculations  
- **Purchase Amount:** mean, median, variance, standard deviation using NumPy.  
- **Age:** statistical measures (mean, median, max, min, std).  
- Leveraged NumPy arrays for faster computation and performance.
